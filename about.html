    <p class="about_me">My name is Bereket Bereket, originally from Ethiopia, I moved to the USA in 2013 when I 
        was in the fourth grade, and I countinued in fourth grade. Transitioning to school in a new country, where the language of 
        instruction was different, presented many challenges. Being unfamiliar with the culture and having no one 
        at school made the adjustment even harder. Despite facing numerous obstacles, I persevered. Now, I find myself at KSU, pursuing 
        an undergraduate degree in IT.
